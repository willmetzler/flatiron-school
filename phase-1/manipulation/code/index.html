The <body> element represents the content of your webpage.
In terms of the DOM tree, the body is the root **parent** of everything on your site.
What we write inside it here is the **static** content of our site.
We'll use JavaScript (and sometimes CSS) to specify things that happen
      **after** load, the **dynamic** content of our site.

<body>
  <!-- In this example, I want the user to see the page's title and author **on load**, -->

  <!-- The <address> element is used to denote a document's contact information. -->
  <!-- In this example, <address> is a child of <body>, and <strong> is a child of <address>. -->
